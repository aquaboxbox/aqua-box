                    <h4>Hangar and Plane</h4>
                    <p>The hangar environment and the plane displayed in the lobby were modelled using Blender. The original
                        plan was to position the camera at various angles around the hangar to create distinct scenes for the
                        main menu, credits, and lobby. However, due to time constraints, the hangar ultimately served only as
                        the lobby environment, leaving much of the geometry behind the plane out of view.

                    <h4>Procedural Terrain</h4>
                    <p>Several approaches were considered for terrain generation. Initially, a triangular binary tree approach was
                        implemented, but due to time constraints, we switched to a geometry clipmap-based approach. In this setup,
                        a pre-defined LOD mesh follows the player, updating all vertices dynamically on the GPU. The heightmap was
                        generated by layering Brownian noise, with each layer's gradients adjusted to simulate natural erosion. To
                        create a canyon, the squared distance from a dampened oscillating sine wave was applied multiple times,
                        producing a “stepped” effect reminiscent of geological formations like the Grand Canyon.

                    <h4>Water Shader</h4>
                    <p>The water effect was achieved through a custom shader that combines depth-based colour blending, dynamic UV
                        offset from a flow map, and foam textures using procedural Voronoi noise. Sampling the camera depth texture
                        transition colours from shallow to deep, while vertex displacement simulates subtle waves. Foam effects are
                        layered by mixing light and dark shades of Voronoi noise, with anti-aliasing smoothing these foam edges and
                        reducing detail at a distance, ensuring optimised rendering for far-off views.

                    <h4>Clouds</h4>
                    <p>The clouds use a full screen render pass which uses raymarching, 3D worley/perlin noise and Beer's law in order
                        to render volumetric clouds. This implementation has the benefit of being able to enter the clouds where the
                        cloud density depends on the camera's position within the cloud.

                    <h4>Fire</h4>
                    <p>The fire effect was created by intersecting three quads. Two of these quads used a fire shader program, while the third
                        represented a burn mark positioned on the plane's wing. The fire shader is used for the fire on the plane's
                        wing, adding an extra element of danger for the players to deal with.

                    <p>The fuel particle system was designed to visually link the collectible rings in the game to the plane's fuel supply. After
                        exploring various options, we chose an effect that appeared in world space. Particles would emit evenly around the collection
                        point and move toward the fuel bar. Animation curves were applied to adjust the speed and movement characteristics of the
                        particles, adding a unique personality to the animation.

                    <p>The player characters' concepts went through many iterations. The design that stuck was the idea of a little bearded gnome-like
                        character. While creating initial models the idea of “flightless birds” also came up, and after some iterations we knew what we
                        had to stick with. The final design is based on a kakapo, a flightless parrot species endemic to New Zealand.

                    <p>Shell texturing was something we knew we had to include in the player characters design from the beginning; initially developed by
                        Lengyel (2000), our implementation adapts Garrett Gunnell's (Acerola) simplified Unity version. The technique works by duplicating
                        a mesh multiple times to form concentric “shells” scaled outward along vertex normals. Each shell samples a noise or fur texture,
                        with an alpha threshold discarding parts of the outer shells to create fur-like density. This stacking effect makes fur appear soft
                        from a distance. Although efficient, artifacts can appear at model edges where shell separation is visible at glancing angles.

                    <p>Our networking and interaction solution connects player phones to a central screen via a WebGL scene: phones access the game through a web
                        browser, where they use a generated join code to connect through the Unity Relay service. Player input, including gyroscope data for
                        movement, is handled on the phone, which updates the player's movement and rotation and sends it to the central screen in real-time. The
                        server manages player connections, assigns colours through a perceptual-based colour model, and handles and maintains player data,
                        ensuring smooth updates and synchronisation across the networked environment.

                    <p class="text-center">From the outset, we aimed to create a unique multiplayer experience using smartphones and a shared public screen. Inspired 
                        by last year's <i><a href="https://agi23-g8.github.io/#/peak-panic-game">Peak Panic</a></i> project, we were excited about building something similar
                        with a fresh take. After an intensive brainstorming phase, we landed on developing a collaborative multiplayer game. We prioritised two main 
                        interaction concepts:</p>
                    <div class="centered-list">
                        <ol>
                            <li><i>Connecting multiple players via smartphone on a shared screen</i></li>
                            <li><i>Incentivising teamwork and collaboration</i></li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                    <p class="text-center">On the graphics side, our team had diverse interests we wanted to explore, and <i>Peak Panic</i>, with its relatively simple gameplay, 
                        offered the perfect canvas. From the start, we identified key areas to focus on:</p>
                    <div class="centered-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>LOD-based Terrain Generation</li>
                            <li>Ray-Traced Cloud Generation</li>
                            <li>Procedural Character Animation</li>
                            <li>Shell Texturing</li>
                            <li>Advanced Water Shaders</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-center">The project naturally grew in scope as development progressed, but we successfully integrated these core elements that initially captivated
                        our interest.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2 class="text-center">Obstacles and Challenges</h2>
                    <p class="text-center">The development of <i>Peak Panic!</i> presented numerous challenges, both expected and unexpected. For us one of the earliest hurdles in the
                        development of the game was the very expected challenge of the networking framework. Even with guidance from the Peak Panic team, networking proved to be
                        complex. We encountered additional technical limitations when working with WebGL and mobile browsers. Many smartphones, particularly iPhones, posed issues:
                        WebGL lacks support for input fields on mobile browsers, and obtaining permissions for gyroscope data proved problematic.</p>
